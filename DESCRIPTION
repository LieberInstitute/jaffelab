Description: The jaffelab contains miscellaneous functions that are commonly
    used in the Jaffe lab http://aejaffe.com/. It is similar in spirit to
    https://cran.r-project.org/package=rafalib and implements several helper
    functions that were using in Lieber Institute for Brain Development
    RNA-sequencing projects such as BrainSEQ Phase I, BrainSEQ Phase II, among
    other ones.
